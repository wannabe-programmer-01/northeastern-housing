Do you guys have any questions about going with which bank? 

This is what I have got *insights from NEU Seniors*

There are lots of factors to consider between this banks 

*Also, one may open bank accounts with multiple banks at right times*


So Based on this factors this is what I was provided information with

🏦 *For BofA* 🏦

If *Age less than 24*

Then No maintenance of balance

If *Age greater than 24*

⚠️You will be required to maintain the minimum monthly balance of 1500 USD or pay a fee of 10 USD per month

⚠️Also they *charge fees for Incoming Wire Charges*

❗⚠️ If you or your parents wants to send money into your US Bank account you will be  charged 14 USD fees

📍📣 *Not Recommended*

🏦 *For Chase Bank* 🏦

❗You could open *Student Checking Account* and could get the *100 USD bonus*

Or 

✅ *Total Checking Account* and you would get *200 USD Bonus*

⚠️ But for this 

*You will need either Direct Deposit set up worth 500 USD every month or 1500 USD monthly minimum balance maintenance*

This is the clause for Chase Banks

📣📣📣

*What Seniors Recommend??* 🤔

1) Get On campus Job or Internship

2) Set Up Direct Deposit with Chase 

3) Open Chase Total Checking Account

4) Not to go with Students Checking Account

 😎😎 *One could always switch from Total Checking Account to Students Checking Account after few months upon request*

 😍😍

Because, *You get Bonus  Only once in each bank*

So *200 USD Bonus > 100 USD Bonus* 

😎😎😍😍

🏦 *Santander Bank* 🏦

One Can Open *Student Checking Account* or Total 

✅No need to maintain the balance of 1500 USD 

✅Free Incoming Wire Charges for Students Account 

✅Best relationship with NEU students

✅Most of the Graduate Students prefer the Santander Bank

*Most Important* 💯

*No Age Restrictions* 👌🏻  

As Recommend by Senior,

1️⃣Initially Open the Bank account with Santander bank

2️⃣Then once you get on campus job go with Chase Total Checking Account

*This are just the few Recommendation from most of the seniors but do research about this before making any decisions*

20/08/22, 17:27 - +91 99777 01122: *BofA* VS *Chase* VS *Santander* VS *Other Bank*

Do you guys have any questions about going with which bank? 

This is what I have got *insights from NEU Seniors*

There are lots of factors to consider between this banks 

*Also, one may open bank accounts with multiple banks at right times*


So Based on this factors this is what I was provided information with

🏦 *For BofA* 🏦

If *Age less than 24*

Then No maintenance of balance

If *Age greater than 24*

⚠️You will be required to maintain the minimum monthly balance of 1500 USD or pay a fee of 10 USD per month

⚠️Also they *charge fees for Incoming Wire Charges*

❗⚠️ If you or your parents wants to send money into your US Bank account you will be  charged 14 USD fees

📍📣 *Not Recommended*

🏦 *For Chase Bank* 🏦

❗You could open *Student Checking Account* and could get the *100 USD bonus*

Or 

✅ *Total Checking Account* and you would get *200 USD Bonus*

⚠️ But for this 

*You will need either Direct Deposit set up worth 500 USD every month or 1500 USD monthly minimum balance maintenance*

This is the clause for Chase Banks

📣📣📣

*What Seniors Recommend??* 🤔

1) Get On campus Job or Internship

2) Set Up Direct Deposit with Chase 

3) Open Chase Total Checking Account

4) Not to go with Students Checking Account

 😎😎 *One could always switch from Total Checking Account to Students Checking Account after few months upon request*

 😍😍

Because, *You get Bonus  Only once in each bank*

So *200 USD Bonus > 100 USD Bonus* 

😎😎😍😍

🏦 *Santander Bank* 🏦

One Can Open *Student Checking Account* or Total 

✅No need to maintain the balance of 1500 USD 

✅Free Incoming Wire Charges for Students Account 

✅Best relationship with NEU students

✅Most of the Graduate Students prefer the Santander Bank

*Most Important* 💯

*No Age Restrictions* 👌🏻  

As Recommend by Senior,

1️⃣Initially Open the Bank account with Santander bank

2️⃣Then once you get on campus job go with Chase Total Checking Account

*This are just the few Recommendation from most of the seniors but do research about this before making any decisions*

24/08/22, 11:17 - +91 80561 01005: You need to deposit a good amount like 2k$ while opening BofA account. And mention that you need a CC. If not it can be rejected
24/08/22, 11:18 - +91 94491 45960: Because I don’t have a credit score
24/08/22, 11:18 - +91 94491 45960: So we have to open an account in BofA first?
24/08/22, 11:18 - +91 80561 01005: Yup

24/08/22, 11:20 - +91 80561 01005: Oh great. This was told by a senior that the CC application will get rejected if money isn’t deposited. Dont have first hand experience tho
24/08/22, 11:20 - +91 94491 45960: What’s the credit limit?
24/08/22, 11:21 - +1 (857) 437-2644: So keep some part of fees in account before opening then take it out 🤣
24/08/22, 11:21 - +91 80561 01005: Yeah gotta do something like this.
24/08/22, 11:21 - +1 (857) 437-2644: Har cheez ka jugaad hota he

24/08/22, 11:26 - +1 (857) 437-2644: Amex is tough to get 😂
24/08/22, 11:26 - +1 (857) 437-2644: With ssn only
24/08/22, 11:27 - +91 80561 01005: You can get it via novacredit if you have good indian credit score. Few of my friends have it.
24/08/22, 11:27 - +91 80561 01005: No ssn
24/08/22, 11:27 - +1 (857) 437-2644: Ok I got it . There are different version of Amex

24/08/22, 11:28 - +91 99679 58547: It's better than take it once you have SSn
24/08/22, 11:28 - +1 (857) 230-8352: One great advantage of amex card is they provide car insurance and if you rent a car here, you can uncheck the insurance provided by the rental agent and  use the amex card for payment
24/08/22, 11:28 - +91 80561 01005: Yeah and 3% back on all payments.
24/08/22, 11:28 - +1 (857) 437-2644: You don’t need a car now 🤣

24/08/22, 11:32 - +91 85888 98351: What shall we buy ?
24/08/22, 11:32 - +1 (857) 437-2644: Rental insurance also u can buy while renting a car like zip car in the bill with 20 usd
24/08/22, 11:32 - +91 95029 97692: Parking is biggest headache and quite expensive
24/08/22, 11:33 - +1 (857) 230-8352: True

24/08/22, 11:34 - +1 (857) 230-8352: But there are situations where we have to take purple trains which can be quite expensive
24/08/22, 11:34 - +1 (857) 230-8352: And if your company is located too far.. obviously you have to arrange car pooling or rent a car
24/08/22, 11:45 - +91 95029 97692: That’s true
24/08/22, 11:45 - +91 95029 97692: In that case you need it

24/08/22, 14:45 - +91 93465 54949: Guys I'm currently in San Francisco and I'll be staying here for 10 days so is it fine if I open a chase account here itself or should I open an account after coming to Boston
24/08/22, 14:46 - +91 87544 58455: You can
24/08/22, 14:46 - +1 (857) 230-8352: You can open there itself...
24/08/22, 14:49 - +91 79722 61704: When we want to transfer usd from our forex card to our US bank account. What sort of charges are incurred.
1. Some are saying around 2% (on whole amount) is charged by our forex provider & additionally bank may charge some insignificant flat small amount.
2. While some are saying only some flat small amount (around 15$) is charged which is insignificant for large amounts.
3. Also, since swiping of forex card is free, cant we swipe our forex card at bank to add money to our US bank account (without any additional charges)
4. OR finally, here the only economical option is to withdraw cash from ATM and deposit in our US bank account.
(Since forex card is the cheapest way to convert INR to USD with minimal exchange/conversion rate, rather than wire transfer)
Any suggestions?

What would be a better bank to open up if your more than 24 years of age ?

- has no minimum balance and has sign up credits
26/08/22, 08:47 - +91 95421 59560: Zolve , but keep one offline bank like BoFa or chase

26/08/22, 09:08 - +91 6360 538 343: No
Apparently they charge $225 dollars for an extra piece of bag
26/08/22, 09:08 - +91 6360 538 343: Emirates
26/08/22, 09:10 - +91 88607 52773: What
26/08/22, 09:10 - +91 70585 87705: 225$ 🙄
26/08/22, 09:10 - +91 97694 59455: Yeah if you get an  extra bag it comes to around $200-250
Depends on the airline tho
26/08/22, 09:11 - +91 97694 59455: I asked Etihad for that. They charge $250 for extra baagage of 23 kg

Even if it's 2-6 kgs extra
26/08/22, 09:12 - +91 70585 87705: Extra baggage of 23kg cost 12100 rs in Emirates. 
It's better to take that one.if we want to exceed the weight 😅
26/08/22, 09:13 - +91 89994 67485: Wtf
26/08/22, 09:14 - +91 89994 67485: I have heard from some students that if we request them and say that we are travelling for the first time then they might waive off extra weight charges
26/08/22, 09:14 - +91 6360 538 343: Yep that's the thing the emirates check in lady told me and made me out my backpack in my cabin trolley
26/08/22, 09:14 - +91 6360 538 343: Extra weight yes, but not extra piece
26/08/22, 09:14 - +91 97694 59455: That depends on the person on the counter
26/08/22, 09:15 - +91 89994 67485: Yes

1️⃣ *Student Checking Account*

--> _Bonus_ : 1️⃣0️⃣0️⃣ 💸

--> _No need to maintain Minimum Monthly Balance of 1500 USD_  ✅

2️⃣ *Total Checking Account*

--> _Bonus_ : 2️⃣0️⃣0️⃣ 💸

--> _Need to maintain Monthly Balance of 1500 USD_  🤐

--> _Or have *Direct Deposit of 500+ USD total every month_  💯

❓*How to get Direct Deposits* ??

--> _Have *On Campus Job or Internship* and get the total amount of 500+ every month_  😎


⚠️ *Any Bank in US will offer Bonus only once* 

✅ So it's *always advisable to open the Total Checking account* in Chase Bank to *get 200 USD Bonus* 😍

--------------------------------------------
🚨 *Hack Alerts* 🚨
--------------------------------------------
1️⃣  *#Hack 1* - _Wait For On campus Job_

Always *wait* till you get the *On Campus Job* !!  🤚

*Once you get it open the Total Checking account*  so as to get bigger bonus of 200 USD ✅

--------------------------------------------
2️⃣ *Hack 2* - _Convert Total Checking account to Student Checking account_

😎 After *90 days of Total Checking account opening* _convert_ it again *into Students Checking Account* 😎

😍 So you won't have to maintain 1500 USD every month* and even if you don't have to maintain Monthly Direct Deposits 😍

Guys this has been done by me personally and hope it should work for you too !!🤪

--------------------------------------------
3️⃣ *Hack 3* - _Asking Banker for 5 years Validity_

*After you have accomplished #Hack 2* , ask Banker to keep the validity of your Students Checking Account as per your *Visa End Date* ✅  and not your *I-20 End Date* ❌

In that way for the remaining years you don't have to worry about the Direct Deposits and all !! 🤑

--------------------------------------------
4️⃣ *Hack 4* - _Applying for Chase Freedom Credit Card_ 💳

Once you *start Internship / Co-op* apply for *Chase Freedom Credit card* and *get 200 Bonus again* 

_Obviously Terms & Conditions applied_ ⚠️
--------------------------------------------
5️⃣  *Hack 5* - _Setting Up Zelle asap_  money 💰

Having *Zelle helps* one *transfer the money to bank account directly* like Gpay, Chillr, etc. 👌

--------------------------------------------
💯 *If you are planning to Open Bank account 🏦 or Credit card 💳 then use this referral* 🤑

Both of us will definitely get benefits 🤪

Do you guys have any questions about going with which bank? 

This is what I have got *insights from NEU Seniors*

There are lots of factors to consider between this banks 

*Also, one may open bank accounts with multiple banks at right times*


So Based on this factors this is what I was provided information with

🏦 *For BofA* 🏦

If *Age less than 24*

Then No maintenance of balance

If *Age greater than 24*

⚠️You will be required to maintain the minimum monthly balance of 1500 USD or pay a fee of 10 USD per month

⚠️Also they *charge fees for Incoming Wire Charges*

❗⚠️ If you or your parents wants to send money into your US Bank account you will be  charged 14 USD fees

📍📣 *Not Recommended*

🏦 *For Chase Bank* 🏦

❗You could open *Student Checking Account* and could get the *100 USD bonus*

Or 

✅ *Total Checking Account* and you would get *200 USD Bonus*

⚠️ But for this 

*You will need either Direct Deposit set up worth 500 USD every month or 1500 USD monthly minimum balance maintenance*

This is the clause for Chase Banks

📣📣📣

*What Seniors Recommend??* 🤔

1) Get On campus Job or Internship

2) Set Up Direct Deposit with Chase 

3) Open Chase Total Checking Account

4) Not to go with Students Checking Account

 😎😎 *One could always switch from Total Checking Account to Students Checking Account after few months upon request*

 😍😍

Because, *You get Bonus  Only once in each bank*

So *200 USD Bonus > 100 USD Bonus* 

😎😎😍😍

🏦 *Santander Bank* 🏦

One Can Open *Student Checking Account* or Total 

✅No need to maintain the balance of 1500 USD 

✅Free Incoming Wire Charges for Students Account 

✅Best relationship with NEU students

✅Most of the Graduate Students prefer the Santander Bank

*Most Important* 💯

*No Age Restrictions* 👌🏻  

As Recommend by Senior,

1️⃣Initially Open the Bank account with Santander bank

2️⃣Then once you get on campus job go with Chase Total Checking Account

*This are just the few Recommendation from most of the seniors but do research about this before making any decisions*

📝 So will be *sharing insights on how one can pay the fees* 

--------------------------------------------

🏦  *Loans from International Non Finance Banking Institutions*, etc. 

💎 Eg: *Prodigy*, *Leap* etc.

They might not disburse money in your US Bank account ❌

--------------------------------------------

🏦 *Loans from Non Indian Government Banks* 

💎 Eg: *Axis*, *HDFC*, *ICICI*, *IDFC*, etc.

😍 -  They can *disburse the loan* to your *Student account in University* or in your *US Bank account as well*  ✅

💡 *Pro Tip* :
 
It's advisable to get the money in your Indian Account first so to earn Interest and then based on USD to INR value get the money Flywire / Forex Card to your US Bank account 😍😍

02/09/22, 00:22 - +91 99777 01122: Wire transfer or paying fees to American bank which is best preferred @919967958547
02/09/22, 00:26 - +91 95029 97692: If it’s bank loan bank will not pay to American bank ( Personal account) 
If own funds I think it’s better to American bank only obviously to avoid Flywire transaction charges 
Currency exchange rate is same to both
02/09/22, 00:27 - +91 99777 01122: Yr pay from American bank it's less chargeable
02/09/22, 00:27 - +91 99777 01122: Why paying own funds through flywire it will cost 1.5 TCS
02/09/22, 00:27 - +91 99777 01122: Which is huge
02/09/22, 00:28 - +91 99777 01122: But if we do wire through bank it will take 0.5 TCS
02/09/22, 00:29 - +91 95029 97692: Don’t pay own funds through Flywire 
Pay through American bank
02/09/22, 00:29 - +91 99679 58547: American bank
02/09/22, 00:29 - +91 99777 01122: Yes it's costly
02/09/22, 00:29 - +91 89396 48118: Tcs applies to transferring to USA bank as well na?
02/09/22, 00:29 - +91 90048 40136: I heard santander bank is good for it?

02/09/22, 16:29 - +91 84472 25977: $1500
02/09/22, 16:30 - +91 99262 46605: When we get to 25 would we then have to keep the minimum balance of 1500?
02/09/22, 16:31 - +91 99262 46605: If I open the account at the age of 24, from next year onwards do I still enjoy the 'no min balance required' policy or does it change to 1500$ required.
02/09/22, 16:33 - +91 80569 45817: I have the same issue as well. 

My bank person said it’d be fine to open a students checking initially. 

Then it may convert to a total checking account. If not due to any systems error, we get to enjoy the no min balance benefit.
02/09/22, 16:34 - +91 80569 45817: Either way, most of the banks do charge a monthly fee or deposit if your 25 years and above.
02/09/22, 16:34 - +1 (617) 909-9502: how much does chase charge from you if u withdraw money from their atm’s
02/09/22, 16:34 - +1 (617) 909-9502: And how much extra charges am I seeing I send money from India to chase account
02/09/22, 16:35 - +91 99262 46605: Yeah, its for BofA I think, that they will refresh the min balance required policy when we turn 25 🥲

02/09/22, 18:54 - +91 89396 48118: Hey guys.
This is Aravind, incoming SES grad student. (
dasarathy.ar@northeastern.edu)

I tried availing my American Express credit card through Nova Credits and it was very smooth.

I was able to transfer my Indian credits to America and this was a great deal to boost my credit score right off the bat! Without requiring an SSN and with 0 annual fees!

Click on this link to transfer your Indian Credits to the USA: http://www.novacredit.com/r/husky

You can avail yourself of a 10$ Amazon gift card at the end. Just make sure to provide the email that is linked with your Amazon while creating your Nova Credits!

I did all of this this from India. You can do the last step of call verification once you're in the USA. You'll get your card to the desired address if approved!

For new students coming to the USA like me, I recommend Blue Cash Everyday AmEx card.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you face any hiccups!

If not, u will get charge of 6$ per month
