09/06/22, 01:27 - +91 89460 50359: Vanakkam Chennai peeps. Been wanting to have an NEU Chennai meetup before we begin flying to Boston.

For the same a place needs to be booked, decided and some other details need to be ironed out. So if anyone's ready to take the lead here and plan it, please do! It'd be great if we could familiarize ourselves with each other before heading to the US!
09/06/22, 01:46 - +91 94431 48102: Yup great idea!

But before we could initiate the plan, how many of y'all would be up for a meet-up? A lil headcount would be great!
09/06/22, 01:49 - +91 97917 71144: 🙋🏻‍♂
09/06/22, 01:49 - +91 89396 48118: Yes wel shall bro?

After that I'll not be here in chennai for a month till 19gh July
09/06/22, 02:00 - +91 98406 13892: Have you all booked flights?

09/06/22, 02:01 - +91 98406 13892: Which airlines?
09/06/22, 02:01 - kashiraman1999: Qatar
09/06/22, 02:02 - kashiraman1999: But u should book immediately
The prices are increasing every week
09/06/22, 02:03 - +91 89460 50359: Since most of us will be busy  with VI, somewhere around mid July should be fine?
09/06/22, 02:03 - +91 89460 50359: 23rd August here
09/06/22, 02:06 - +91 99401 86047: I have booked for 21st August
09/06/22, 02:07 - +91 94431 48102: Yup 31st aug. KLM airlines with a 4 hour layover at Amsterdam. Flight is from banglore though. Got the cheapest deal that way!
09/06/22, 02:07 - +91 95001 70945: Ive booked for 25th august, Qatar.

My lease starts on 1st sept only. where do y'all plan to stay if you reach before the lease starts ? what are the options
09/06/22, 02:10 - +91 94459 61709: +1
09/06/22, 02:11 - +91 80562 14824: Airbnb
09/06/22, 02:11 - +91 94431 48102: Airbnbs prolly. But we'll have to book the airbnbs pretty early
09/06/22, 02:12 - +91 94431 48102: Boston being a college City will be FULL during aug last week/sept first week
09/06/22, 02:12 - +91 80562 14824: And they have increased their rates too and it will be even more as we go near to August
09/06/22, 02:13 - +91 94431 48102: Yup. Exactly
09/06/22, 02:27 - +91 89195 06898: I booked for Qatar too.
Booking directly from the Qatar website is the best option as they don't charge cancellation fees, unlike booking from third parties.(not sure about other airlines though)
09/06/22, 02:39 - +91 89460 50359: Can we have a count please?
09/06/22, 02:41 - +91 79040 38948: +1

23/06/22, 09:49 - +91 79040 38948: Heyy,
Two sharing spots available.
 Me and my friend have finalized one apartment in commonwealth avenue.

Rent will be around 610-620 dollars with heat and hot water included , it will be a 2bhk with both rooms being big enough to easily accommodate 2 people.

The apartment is very spacious with lots of space to move around and chill. We prioritized that over distance to the university

All 4 of us will be on the lease, so its completely legal for all 4 of us to stay there.

Plus there will be no security deposit or broker fee, the only deposits will be the first and last month rent.

Anyone completed immunization?
02/07/22, 01:56 - +91 82485 98448: We just have to fill that form, and get it signed by our family doctor right?
02/07/22, 02:04 - +91 89396 48118: That is there, but I would like to have it tested for my own personal safety.
02/07/22, 02:04 - +91 82485 98448: So you'll  cross check vaccines and take what you've not taken?
02/07/22, 02:05 - +91 89396 48118: Yes looking to do that.
02/07/22, 02:24 - +91 91766 88955: If we have proof of vaccination taken at birth, can we show that and get attestation from doctor

02/07/22, 02:53 - +91 80562 14824: It depends if u r planning to go for a paritcular vaccine it’s cost something like u said but if u planning to take multiple vaccines it would be much more ig
02/07/22, 02:53 - +91 89396 48118: Bro. It'll be 100x costlier if we get hit by any of those diseases in USA. 😂

02/07/22, 02:55 - +91 80562 14824: They ask us to put the same dates as we have in our vaccine card
02/07/22, 02:55 - +91 80562 14824: 3 doc said me this
02/07/22, 02:55 - +91 89396 48118: I see.
02/07/22, 02:55 - +91 94443 36108: I took titer test for all (MMR, varicella and hepatitis b)

02/07/22, 02:55 - +91 80562 14824: Tier test can always be done
02/07/22, 02:56 - +91 94443 36108: You don’t have to take if you are immune
