Atleast 2/5 of I20 cost should be covered from sponsorship.

Rest as loan.

Thank you for clarifying. For the Reserve Closed sections, the "open seats" you are seeing for this particular section have been reserved by your department for students in the PlusOne Accelerated Master's program and this is why you are receiving the reserved/closed registration error.

The MS EM department plans to open additional sections end of June.

Please let me know if you have additional questions.

15/06/22, 09:02 - +91 90733 31977: Hi, everyone! 

I am Aranya and I'll be starting my Master's in Engineering Management program at Northeastern University from the Fall 2022 intake onwards. I'm actively looking for accomodations and roommates at the moment and I'm eager to finalize the same at the earliest. 

I've come across a nice *3 Bedroom, 1 Kitchen, 1 Bathroom (NO HALL)* apartment üè† *less than 1 mile from Northeastern University üéì*. I will be taking a single bedroom myself and I am currently looking for 3 more people to share the apartment with; *2 people to share and occupy the large, spacious Master Bedroom* AND *1 person to occupy the second single room*.

The rent üíµüí∞ *INCLUDING HEAT AND HOT WATER* is:

*For each Master Bedroom sharing spot: $625 per month*
*For the single bedroom spot - $850 per month*

*PROS*:

*1) All the tenants (4 people including myself) will have their names on the lease*.
*2) 10 minutes walking distance from Northeastern University, so commuting to and from the university will not be an issue*.
*3) It's in Fenway, one of the best neighborhoods around the university, so safe surroundings are guaranteed!*

I do not have any specific preferences, however, I'd like to prioritise people who have already finalized NEU and have least booked their visa interview slots and are willing to pay and complete reserving the apartment with me.

*If your requirements match with the above and you're interested, then kindly DM me. I'll be more than happy to connect and talk about any other preferences and queries!*

Is Texas a&m better than Northeastern,
19/06/22, 12:35 - +91 80561 76459: Depends on several factor, but primarily, what course?
19/06/22, 12:36 - +91 70128 25886: Obviously mem
19/06/22, 12:36 - +91 70128 25886: Mainly looking at Opportunity wise, rank, quality etc
19/06/22, 12:45 - +91 80561 76459: NEU is better in terms of co-op and the concentration for supply chain, product management , data analytics.  Hence there is plenty of opportunities once you finish. TAMU is slightly ranked lower than NEU but in terms of living, Texas is cheap and you could save a lot. The weather is also more suited for Indians in Texas. But at the end of the day, it's your priorities that matter.

26/06/22, 03:48 - +91 99238 79504: Hey guys, 
About to book the flight today, 
Can anybody provide any suggestions which is most preferably
26/06/22, 03:55 - +91 96206 02233: Try where they give student discount ( you will have to upload offer letter)
Eg: Qatar airways
26/06/22, 03:56 - +91 95157 21738: Which city are you from?
26/06/22, 03:56 - +91 95157 21738: Usually flights are cheapest from Delhi
26/06/22, 03:57 - +91 99238 79504: Pune
26/06/22, 03:57 - +91 95157 21738: And if you take a flight with multiple airlines.. it's preferable you take the ones with Air India in the first leg as they will give you 2 pieces of checked in luggage
26/06/22, 03:59 - +91 86398 65328: Emirates gives three for students 3*23
26/06/22, 04:00 - +91 95157 21738: Yea
26/06/22, 04:00 - +91 95157 21738: Etihad also
26/06/22, 04:01 - +91 95157 21738: But I've seen if it's a single airline flight from India to US directly with maybe 1 stop.. rates quite higher
26/06/22, 04:02 - +91 99238 79504: Anybody checked with Lufthansa??
26/06/22, 04:03 - +91 95157 21738: On the expensive end
26/06/22, 04:04 - +91 95157 21738: You can check this since it goes through Abu Dhabi. You have pre clearance available there.
26/06/22, 04:14 - +91 99238 79504: Anybody booked Etihad?
26/06/22, 04:24 - +91 97500 00540: Etihad doesn't fly to Boston
26/06/22, 04:24 - +91 97241 86425: True
26/06/22, 04:24 - +91 97241 86425: only
26/06/22, 04:25 - +91 97241 86425: emirates and qatar
26/06/22, 04:28 - +91 99238 79504: <Media omitted>
26/06/22, 04:30 - +91 97500 00540: You can see the flights right there, Bombay to Abu Dhabi to New York to Boston
26/06/22, 04:30 - +91 95157 21738: I did but to JFK.. coz its close to my family there. I didn't check if it flies to Boston or not
26/06/22, 04:31 - +91 97500 00540: If you don't have confirmed plans for travel onwards to Boston by the start of your course you might be denied entry at the border so watch out for that
26/06/22, 04:33 - +91 97695 55101: +1?
26/06/22, 04:40 - +91 95157 21738: If I can show accomodation in Boston before program start date, do you think it would be enough as proof?
26/06/22, 04:43 - +91 99238 79504: Hey - anybody booked Qatar Airway - please connect with me
26/06/22, 04:54 - +91 86398 65328: Make sure you did not apply to any colleges in New York State, even if you did delete all data pertaining to that on your phone before landing
26/06/22, 04:55 - +91 95157 21738: got it
26/06/22, 05:38 - +91 97500 00540: I'm not sure, the story I heard stated nothing of that
Just that he landed in Boston but his college was in Chicago and he had no proof of onward travel to Chicago
26/06/22, 15:15 - +91 97241 86425: Anyone done with vaccination?
26/06/22, 15:17 - +91 99406 45695: No.

As per seniors, NEU is vaccinating (booster shot) us at free of cost.
26/06/22, 15:18 - +91 97241 86425: What about other vaccines
26/06/22, 15:21 - +91 99406 45695: I took first two doses of COVIDSHIELD vaccine and this is accepted. Only for booster Covidshield is not accepted, as it not approved by FDA and it is not listed.

27/06/22, 01:50 - +91 97241 86425: what does this cost ?

27/06/22, 01:55 - +91 99202 70805: Had anyone submitted prior to this new one coming out?
27/06/22, 01:55 - +91 86398 65328: Most of them you would have taken in your childhood so just do a antibody test

26/07/22, 02:56 - +91 96206 02233: ohh

26/07/22, 02:58 - +91 80560 46315: Earlier I faced the same issue and I mailed the university regarding it and they sent me a list of CRNs dedicated to MEM
26/07/22, 02:58 - +91 80560 46315: But unfortunately all these classes are full so we can only register for co-op in the next semester
26/07/22, 02:59 - +91 96206 02233: or if they open up new slots
26/07/22, 02:59 - +91 80560 46315: In this case, yes. But If they don‚Äôt, then next semester it is
26/07/22, 03:00 - +91 96206 02233: cool
26/07/22, 06:12 - +91 97241 86425: Anyone paying fees from USA via relatives?

26/07/22, 08:52 - +91 84460 19450: +1
26/07/22, 09:04 - +91 98496 14763: So basically you can pay your semester fee monthly instead of paying all at once, so they have two types of monthly plans a 5 month one and a 4 month one, your semester bill will be split according to your monthly plan, so to register for the 5 month plan the deadline is aug 1st

05/08/22, 00:23 - +91 86398 65328: üì£ *F22 Students :::: For Fees Payment Deadline* ‚è∞

Guys, as per what I have come to know from several people that *Fees Billing Statement*  üìù is already generated and there's a deadline approaching soon üîú

üî∞ *Given the fact that people are yet to get their loan disbursed or approved || Proper arrangements if Self Financing, etc*, one can take some insightful chill pill and keep calm !! 

Don't be in a rush to accomplish all the tasks straight away !!  

üóìÔ∏è *As per the previous years experience, university has been flexible when it comes to accepting the payment, there's no hard deadline as such and has been supported for multiple students !!* ü´Ç

üìí They are also considerate about International Students and know what challenges one faces after taking the loan and several other things !! 

‚è∞  *Ideal Time to pay off the fees and dues is before 2 months from the term end date* so that one can enroll for next semester classes and register for other stuff too!! 

‚ö†Ô∏è Please don't treat this message as a command, *you need to do your own research first* and do *ask Students Finance Department about flexibility in paying fees* as well as *Late Fees Waiver etc.*

üíØ *Don't held anyone responsible for your inconveniences !!*

üí° *Pro Tip* : Right now *USD to INR value* is around 80, it can go up or down in next few months !! 

*If the value goes down to 76 or 77 you will save a lot of money ü§ë in Flywire Charges* ‚úÖ

*If it goes beyond 80 then you will have to pay more obviously !!* ‚ùå 

üìä *Continuously monitor* the USD to INR value and when you feel the *right time* ‚ñ∂Ô∏è strikes *pay it asap* !! 

üìç *How to Pay the Fees* ? :- 

üü¢ *Flywire* : 

üü¢ *NU Pay - Online or Offline* ---->

‚úÖ One can use *Debit Card, Credit card, Forex Card and US Bank account for this* !!

‚ùì *Do one needs to Opt for Installment based Payment plan* ? ----> 

üßê *Suggestion will be No* as one will pay unecesaary extra money for that. *, Instead pay the money at your pace and convenience but yes inside the stipulated time* üòé

‚ö†Ô∏è *Do coordinate with your loan provider, etc. before making any decisions* ‚ö†Ô∏è

‚úâÔ∏è _*DISCLAIMER*_ : 

*THIS MSG IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSE ONLY. ‚ÑπÔ∏è ONE DOESN'T NEED TO FOLLOW THIS IF YOU HAVE YOUR OWN RESEARCH DONE !! NO ONE SHOULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY INCONVENIENCE*
