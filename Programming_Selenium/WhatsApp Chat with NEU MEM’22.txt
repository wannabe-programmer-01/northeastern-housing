I've come come across a *2 Bedroom, 1 Kitchen, 1 Bathroom (NO HALL)* apartment (the hall has been converted into the second bedroom) 🏠 *less than 1 mile from Northeastern University 🎓*. I'm looking to share the apartment with one other person. 

The rent for a private spot 💵💰 *INCLUDING HEAT AND HOT WATER* is: $995 per month

*I've talked to the broker and I would like to finalize and submit the application for the apartment *WITHIN A DAY*or at the earliest. Hence, I'll prioritise people who have already finalized NEU, have at least secured a visa interview slot, and are willing to pay a minimal application fee and the first month's rent amount right away, so that we can go ahead and submit our application for the landlord's consideration without any further delays.*

*If your requirements match with the above and you're interested to finalize a private accomodation at once, then kindly DM me. I'll be more than happy to connect and talk about preferences and other queries!*

24/06/22, 02:41 - +91 90733 31977: ### *PRIVATE ROOM FINDERS REJOICEE!* ###

Hey guys,

I'm really thrilled to let you know that I've found a really, really spacious *5 bedroom, 1 bathroom apartment* in the *Mission Hill* area and I'm looking to share the apartment with *4 other people each taking a private room* as a permanent accomodation from *1st September 2022* onwards. 

*3 out of the 4 bedrooms are really big and spacious and there's one bedroom which is smaller in size but equally cozy and comfortable!*

The rent for each of the 3 bigger private bedrooms 💵💰 *INCLUDING HEAT AND HOT WATER* is: *$850 per month*
The rent for the smaller private bedroom💵💰 *INCLUDING HEAT AND HOT WATER* is: *$600 per month*

*PROS*:

*1) Just 1.2 miles from Northeastern University 🎓; that's only a 20-25 minute walk.*
*2) It's in Mission Hill, one of the most student friendly and best neighborhoods around the university, so safe surroundings are guaranteed.*
*3) The unit is RIGHT on 📍 Huntington Avenue, so connectivity to the university is ample and really convenient through modes of public transport.* 🚉🚍
*4) Each private bedroom can easily fit beds 🛌, chairs💺, study tables and still have space remaining, so you get your money's worth!*
*5) Each bedroom has it's own built-in closet, so storage won't be an issue for any of the tenants.*
*6) All of the tenants, including myself, will have their names on the lease and that is a guarantee!* 📜
*7) Utilities that are included in your rent are heating and hot water.*
*8) The apartment is really big and spacious, so you'll definitely feel at home.*

*I've talked to the broker about the entire process of application, so I'd like to provide a bit more information than usual here. There are three other interested groups in Boston who have scheduled in-person viewing of the same apartment on Friday 9 AM EST onwards, which will be today Friday 6:30 ⏲️ PM evening IST for us here in India. That's why I would REALLY, REALLY like to find 4 seriously interested people who would definitely confirm their presence by 6:30 PM⏳ today, or else we risk losing the apartment to other potential groups already there in Boston.* 

*All you need to do by 6:30 PM today is confirm your presence to me, send me your I-20 and passport and let me know of your full names and email addresses, so that an application form can be sent to you to fill up and submit. 📋We need to have all 4 roommates, 5 including myself ready by 6:30 PM today, so that as soon as the broker sends the applications to us at 9 AM their time, we can fill them up and submit them. Needless to mention, you may have to stay up a bit late tonight and be alert for the broker's mail, and judging by how responsive he's been throughout the process, I'd definitely not expect any delay.*

*I would prioritise people who have already finalized NEU and have at least secured a visa interview slot, and would be willing to pay a minimal application fee and the first month's rent amount right away, so that we can go ahead and submit our applications for their consideration without any further delay. ⏲️⏲️*

*If your requirements match with the above, you're also looking for nice, private bedrooms and you're even a little interested, then kindly DM me. I'll be more than happy to connect and talk about preferences and other queries!*

03/07/22, 10:24 - +91 90733 31977: Can somebody please let me know how the UHCS form works? Do we need to have all the details regarding when we'd taken the doses of all the required and/or recommended vaccinations or can we bypass this in some way?
03/07/22, 10:37 - +91 97572 70717: If you don’t have the exact dates or if you haven’t taken them yet you can get antibody titer tests for the following:
Measles
Mumps
Rubella
Diptheria
Pertussis
Tetanus
Varicella
Hepatitis B

If you have been vaccinated before you’ll have enough antibodies to show evidence of immunity. If not you’ll have to get vaccinated now.
03/07/22, 10:40 - +91 90733 31977: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.
03/07/22, 10:40 - +91 90733 31977: Has anybody got feedback from the university after having mailed them the form?

03/07/22, 10:43 - +91 86398 65328: There is no antibody for Tdap , you either need to show proof of vaccination in the last 10 years or take a new vaccine
03/07/22, 11:13 - +91 78380 48889: Guys honestly, are you getting it done ? 
Or just asking the local docs to share the report
03/07/22, 11:20 - +91 95150 54919: No problem if NEU didn't get noticed. But they have clearly mentioned in the website that when Ever they need they can test for those mentioned and if test showed not immune they will charge you for test and for that vaccination.

27/07/22, 01:19 - +91 90499 11666: I second this, both Stavya Bhatia and Riddhi Shah from Roombae.com were not at all helpful in finding an apartment and finally we had to go with another broker!
27/07/22, 01:20 - +91 79776 03893: I am in touch with Riddhi. She is showing us apartment too far from the university. I told her you might as well show us the apartment in New York as well!

I would not blame them for that

27/07/22, 01:42 - +91 95421 59560: Remaining was only 1700$
27/07/22, 01:42 - +91 95052 45867: You need to understand that it's not HIS APARTMENT.

For all those who are coming to NU in fall 22, you must get a credit card before coming to Boston through Zolve and start building your credit history from the day you land here. Most of 2021 fall & 2022 spring people use Zolve even now as there is no credit card interest for 1 year, so we would suggest you to use Zolve for a year, then move on to Discover, Chase when you get a SSN after on campus job.

17/12/22, 13:01 - +1 (617) 331-0450: Hey everyone, a lot of people contacted me about which course to choose. I want to tell it on the group so everyone benefits. 🙂

IE 7270 - Intelligent manufacturing is THE COURSE you should be doing if you’re thinking of a career in manufacturing/supply chain.

The course will teach you about advanced manufacturing systems, robotics, 3D printing, laser cutting along with implementing AI & ML in manufacturing & supply chains. (The AI/ML component is amazing, it’ll boost your resume & give you talking points in interviews next sem)

It is a 7000 series course, but it will NOT be very tough. The Professor is excellent, experienced and grades well.

Many mechanical engineering grad students including me regret that we couldn’t do this course as it has a pre-requisite (prob & stats) which most of you would have done.

The course is offered in Spring only. So do consider this course if it suits your long term goals.

Ping me if you have any more doubts. 😊
