13/05/22, 05:41 - kashiraman1999: They ask for a pdf of dollar to INR conversion
13/05/22, 05:42 - +91 84475 85502: It's not mentioned in my letter
13/05/22, 05:42 - kashiraman1999: So better to go to that website and print as pdf to upload
13/05/22, 05:42 - +91 84475 85502: Should merge the conversion pdf and the sanction letter pdf and then upload

13/05/22, 09:34 - +91 80957 13277: I was under the impression that they would first assign a academic counselor and then go ahead with course registration
13/05/22, 09:35 - Jay Oza NEU: Yeah same.
13/05/22, 09:37 - +91 80561 76459: They already did assign an academic advisor...check your offer letter
13/05/22, 09:38 - +91 90733 31977: Even I thought there'd be some formal discussions or something before course registrations.
13/05/22, 09:39 - +91 98496 14763: Your academic point of contact in mentioned in the offer letter itself it's either himalona or babak
13/05/22, 09:39 - +91 95157 39225: Yes, that‚Äôs true. So, are we supposed to just drop her an email if we want to discuss about the courses?
13/05/22, 09:40 - +91 98496 14763: Actually for spring 22 coe themselves send a list of courses which we choose for the first semester

15/05/22, 07:46 - +91 91679 34442: Try opening it in incognito and clear the cache files
15/05/22, 07:46 - +91 91679 34442: It works most of the time
15/05/22, 08:52 - +91 83328 81543: Did you recieve the receipt yet?
15/05/22, 08:52 - +91 91679 34442: No

15/05/22, 09:40 - +91 90089 44967: Academic
15/05/22, 09:41 - +91 98496 14763: And also while filling the undergraduate details i only mentioned it as computer science and engineering instead of Bachelor of engineering in computer science and engineering
15/05/22, 09:42 - +91 98496 14763: It's fine right??
15/05/22, 10:57 - +91 96737 08383: Try to book flights asap. Booking late will be very expensive, as prices have already risen in the past month. Try to go for reputed airlines (Emirates, Qatar, etc). They will handle all covid, flight adjustment, etc issues very smoothly. Some are also offering free rescheduling/cancellation (I know of Qatar). Also, be sure to take advantage of Student programs for your airlines. Most of the good ones, have some form of the student program, club, etc, and ask you to upload admit letter. These programs give additional discounts. Emirates and Qatar definitely have them. Try and look out for others also.

Also, when you're about to book flight seats, do check this website: https://www.seatguru.com/ (enter your flight number here), and this site will tell you what all seats are good (information which airlines hide from you) (like, whether a seat has limited recline capacity or storage capacity due to washroom/entertainment box, etc)

I booked my ticket from Qatar, using their student program, which can be found here:

I got a couple of listings which am interested in all from 500-1000usd range can adjust anywhere between, but looking for people to move in together(preferably 2 or 3 excluding me).
The higher spectrum of the budget am looking to rent 3bhk/ 2bhk+hall which would be individual rooms in shared space (cost can be anywhere from 800-1000)
If its under 650 then sharing with 4 people for 2bhk/1bh+hall
personal preferences : non-vegetarian and non-smokers

18/05/22, 06:43 - +91 81053 79956: Check the department website for any updates. Basically they‚Äôre asking you to wait.
18/05/22, 06:43 - +91 81053 79956: And they don‚Äôt have a fixed time and date as to when the portal will be active
18/05/22, 06:44 - +91 81053 79956: Classic move - to avoid traffic, else the server will go down.
18/05/22, 06:44 - +91 88704 23834: I think we can still drop or change the course regardless if we register now
18/05/22, 06:44 - +91 81053 79956: And in this case they‚Äôre probably still handing out admits, so idk good chance they‚Äôre asking us to wait
18/05/22, 06:44 - +91 81053 79956: Source?
18/05/22, 06:45 - +91 81053 79956: U sure we can do this? Genuinely asking because didn‚Äôt hear about this earlier
18/05/22, 06:46 - +91 88704 23834: its only speculation on my part because the fall 2022 registrations are open until dec 30th it says, and ik for a fact we can drop classes before it starts i think
18/05/22, 06:48 - +91 81053 79956: Dec 30th!?!?
18/05/22, 06:48 - Nikhil Madhavan Neu MEM: Yeah, we can change the course as long as there is availability in the course you want to register in. But this has to be done within a month ig.
18/05/22, 06:48 - +91 81053 79956: Yeah I mean you can drop it anytime you want no. So yes the one month thing seems reasonable
18/05/22, 06:49 - +91 88704 23834: <Media omitted>
18/05/22, 06:49 - +91 81053 79956: What is this üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ pls tell me it‚Äôs a typo from their end because it makes nooo sense lmao
18/05/22, 06:52 - +91 88704 23834: i think it might be for dropping a class, if you are not satisfied with it.. but then again i have no clue its only my speculations
18/05/22, 06:52 - +91 96320 31602: It might be 8am EST which is 5:30pm IST right?
18/05/22, 06:53 - +91 88704 23834: yea this is correct, but check end date
18/05/22, 06:53 - +91 99628 99042: Dec 30th? Pretty sure it's a typo
18/05/22, 06:53 - +91 99628 99042: Or for dropping the course maybe?
18/05/22, 06:53 - +91 99628 99042: Which doesn't really make sense
18/05/22, 06:53 - +91 94050 59320: Can somebody share the link of course registration
18/05/22, 06:53 - +91 96320 31602: Or maybe the registration window remains open till the sem ends
18/05/22, 06:53 - +91 81053 79956: Yes
18/05/22, 06:54 - +91 88704 23834: this is the only reason mostly, because its obvious you cant register once classes have commenced
18/05/22, 06:54 - +91 81053 79956: +1
18/05/22, 06:54 - +91 88704 23834: but it was a supporting argument to if we can drop courses or not for when they asked
18/05/22, 07:06 - +91 99622 08222: June 26 July 8
18/05/22, 07:16 - +91 85002 89622: <Media omitted>
18/05/22, 07:18 - +91 98496 14763: You can drop classes only if register for new courses in place of the old ones

18/05/22, 07:37 - kashiraman1999: Isn't it advisable to register today as slots will get full?

18/05/22, 08:38 - +91 82908 50903: I think most are full, just look for teachers which have free seats
18/05/22, 08:40 - +91 90088 05976: Hany sadaka is good I‚Äôve heard
18/05/22, 08:41 - +91 99628 99042: He's good but strict apparently
18/05/22, 08:41 - +91 70939 47016: I'm not able to add the coop course for some reason
18/05/22, 08:41 - +91 88704 23834: Is the intro to co-op recommended for 1st sem or can pass to complete in 2nd sem
18/05/22, 08:41 - +91 96631 03704: Is Rajesh full or is it possible to be on waitlist?
18/05/22, 08:42 - +91 96631 03704: For probability and stats?
18/05/22, 08:42 - +91 75064 13835: +1
18/05/22, 08:42 - +91 75064 13835: Is this for 1st sem? Coop?

18/05/22, 08:44 - +91 81053 79956: But we‚Äôre not allowed to do a co-op in the first sem right?
18/05/22, 08:44 - +91 99723 39681: I'm not able to find the engineering probability class 
How to find that ?

18/05/22, 08:45 - +91 96631 03704: But the option is available, isn‚Äôt that odd?
18/05/22, 08:46 - +91 99628 99042: Maybe they're full bro
18/05/22, 08:47 - +91 81053 79956: It is odd. Because literally everyone is like yoi can‚Äôt do coop in the first and last semesters
18/05/22, 08:47 - +91 99628 99042: Seriously. I saw everyone telling to register for it and I went ahead
18/05/22, 08:47 - +91 99628 99042: But doesn't make sense
18/05/22, 08:48 - +91 70939 47016: Instructional mode : traditional means that it's on campus right
18/05/22, 08:48 - +91 95035 19159: Can we register later aswell??
18/05/22, 08:48 - +91 88704 23834: coop you cant, but this is a pre req course for it tho right? or even that we arent supposed to take 1st sem
18/05/22, 08:49 - +91 81053 79956: What üòÇüòÇüòÇ
All alumni and current students have told you can‚Äôt
18/05/22, 08:49 - +91 81053 79956: You need a 3.4+ gpa to even apply or something
18/05/22, 08:49 - +91 81053 79956: Not sure if the exact figure but like there‚Äôs definitely a GPA criteria there
18/05/22, 08:49 - +91 99628 99042: My friend who's studying currently told me to register tho
18/05/22, 08:49 - +91 70939 47016: It's just the intro course and a pre requisite for the co op right ?
18/05/22, 08:49 - +91 70939 47016: It should be fine
18/05/22, 08:50 - +91 70939 47016: Do we have to do anything after registering and it shows up in active registrations ?
18/05/22, 08:50 - +91 99628 99042: I don't think so
18/05/22, 08:50 - +91 81053 79956: Idk, I‚Äôve been told by a lot of my seniors that register after first term. Not sure what the real scene is, then
18/05/22, 08:50 - +91 95035 19159: That's intro to coop 1 credit course.. mandatory if you are planning to do coop
18/05/22, 08:50 - +91 70939 47016: So we can just log out ?
18/05/22, 08:51 - +91 88704 23834: i've registered for now, but if anyone is going to vouch that it might be a little bit taxing on the workload for incoming students i plan to drop
18/05/22, 08:51 - +91 99628 99042: I really wish, at this point lol
18/05/22, 08:51 - +91 99628 99042: Same
18/05/22, 08:51 - +91 99628 99042: Is it? My friend suggested I register for it rn
18/05/22, 08:52 - +91 84460 19450: Hi how many courses should we register to ideally right now?
18/05/22, 08:52 - +91 82908 50903: I think it's better to take it in 1st sem as we will busy next sem with courses as well as searching for co-op
18/05/22, 08:53 - +91 96631 03704: Same
18/05/22, 08:53 - +91 99628 99042: 3

18/05/22, 09:06 - +91 90733 31977: Same question
18/05/22, 09:08 - Jay Oza NEU: There are so many faculty and locations and time and stuff....How are we supposed to know what fits for us so early on?

I think slots might open up during our orientation as well
18/05/22, 09:08 - +91 99484 07000: guys for probability and statistics, suggest one
rajesh is full
18/05/22, 09:08 - +91 99723 39681: Hanai is good 
One of my seniors told me
18/05/22, 09:09 - +91 83328 81543: Very strict with grading according to what I heard
18/05/22, 09:09 - +91 99484 07000: yea i heard too
18/05/22, 09:09 - +91 99484 07000: it seems he keeps many exams too
18/05/22, 09:10 - +91 90733 31977: That's my main question, we're all chasing course registrations even before the orientation has happened, based on other people's experiences. Not ideal tbh.
18/05/22, 09:10 - +91 99628 99042: People who took douglas schmucker, it's showing online tho?
18/05/22, 09:11 - +91 90733 31977: Is there any faculty for Introduction to Co-op other than Kristina Hals?

18/05/22, 09:14 - +91 83328 81543: I took Fard but that was because of miscommunication between me and an existing student
18/05/22, 09:15 - +91 99723 39681: You can still change right ?
18/05/22, 09:15 - +91 99723 39681: How is pei, jinxiang for stats ?
18/05/22, 09:15 - +91 83328 81543: Yeah but just looking for an alternative prob and stats professor other than Rajesh

19/05/22, 01:45 - +91 99628 99042: Lol what? üíÄ
19/05/22, 01:46 - +91 94463 11520: I had told many times that its supposed to b done only after orientation process
19/05/22, 01:46 - +91 83328 81543: Are class slots going to open for new students after orientation though
19/05/22, 01:46 - +91 99628 99042: Where did you get this tho?
19/05/22, 01:47 - +91 94463 11520: But anyways no worries, even if they cancel for the students who registered from fall 2022.... Itll b gone for all and v mayb able to do it afresh
19/05/22, 01:47 - +91 94463 11520: Perhaps
19/05/22, 01:47 - +91 94463 11520: Other MEM group someone shared and said its shown in the acceptance letter
19/05/22, 01:47 - +91 94463 11520: Please check whether its there
19/05/22, 01:48 - +91 84475 85502: <Media omitted>
19/05/22, 01:48 - +91 83328 81543: Something similar is mentioned there but seniors told me to register as slots get filled and you won't get the to register for the class
19/05/22, 01:49 - +91 83328 81543: So perhaps they went through the same ?
19/05/22, 01:49 - +91 94463 11520: Seee..... The same stuff is mentioned here in all our letters.... Since they haven't even given out an official email
19/05/22, 01:49 - +91 94463 11520: Mayb they must have thought that v r spring students
19/05/22, 01:49 - +91 94463 11520: Bcos the registration timing did anyone notice it starts from May and ends on Dec only
19/05/22, 01:50 - +91 83328 81543: No no they knew i am a new student
19/05/22, 01:50 - +91 95035 19159: Most of us registered... It won't be a problem... If they cancel we can register again else it should be okay
19/05/22, 01:50 - +91 94463 11520: But what I don't understand is why were v able to register in the 1st place if v weren't supposed to... Mayb its some technical issue from their side
19/05/22, 01:50 - +91 99628 99042: My friend told me the same thing as well
19/05/22, 01:50 - +91 94463 11520: Not sure.... Bcoa even in videos its mentioned to register only after orientation
19/05/22, 01:50 - +91 94463 11520: Yehah exactly no need to worry though
19/05/22, 01:51 - +91 94463 11520: Thats the best part
19/05/22, 01:51 - +91 83328 81543: Exactly ..that's what I told ..they shouldn't have opened registration for new students before orientation
19/05/22, 01:51 - +91 94463 11520: All can relax
19/05/22, 01:54 - +91 70205 13653: Can you share which Profs you selected?

20/05/22, 14:10 - +91 81053 79956: For I-20 you show the balance statement. For VI you need to show 6 months‚Äô transaction/bank statement with all line transactions
20/05/22, 14:10 - +91 81053 79956: The former is just a page long document that highlights your bank balance.
20/05/22, 14:10 - +91 81053 79956: The latter indicates your financial activity
20/05/22, 14:18 - +91 98422 36189: Of course!

15/06/22, 04:12 - +91 75987 59733: Hi Nikhil,

Thank you for clarifying. For the Reserve Closed sections, the "open seats" you are seeing for this particular section have been reserved by your department for students in the PlusOne Accelerated Master's program and this is why you are receiving the reserved/closed registration error. Unfortunately, these seats are not available to graduate students to register for at this time. Please continue to check back to the schedule for any changes or newly open seats. The MS EM department plans to open additional sections end of June.

Please let me know if you have additional questions.
15/06/22, 04:19 - +91 84337 56060: Okk

Anyone here who is waiting for greencard(family immigration category) and has applied for Student visa. 
Please connect. 
Thanks
15/06/22, 09:01 - +91 90733 31977: Hi, everyone! 

I am Aranya and I'll be starting my Master's in Engineering Management program at Northeastern University from the Fall 2022 intake onwards. I'm actively looking for accomodations and roommates at the moment and I'm eager to finalize the same at the earliest. 

I've come across a nice *3 Bedroom, 1 Kitchen, 1 Bathroom (NO HALL)* apartment üè† *less than 1 mile from Northeastern University üéì*. I will be taking a single bedroom myself and I am currently looking for 3 more people to share the apartment with; *2 people to share and occupy the large, spacious Master Bedroom* AND *1 person to occupy the second single room*.

The rent üíµüí∞ *INCLUDING HEAT AND HOT WATER* is:

*For each Master Bedroom sharing spot: $625 per month*
*For the single bedroom spot - $850 per month*

*PROS*:

*1) All the tenants (4 people including myself) will have their names on the lease*.
*2) 10 minutes walking distance from Northeastern University, so commuting to and from the university will not be an issue*.
*3) It's in Fenway, one of the best neighborhoods around the university, so safe surroundings are guaranteed!*

I do not have any specific preferences, however, I'd like to prioritise people who have already finalized NEU and have least booked their visa interview slots and are willing to pay and complete reserving the apartment with me.

*If your requirements match with the above and you're interested, then kindly DM me. I'll be more than happy to connect and talk about any other preferences and queries, if any!*

I have a permanent accomodation consisting of *2 SHARING SPOTS* on hold for the next 24 hours or so  *less than 1 mile from Northeastern University üéì* with the lease starting from *1st September 2022*.

The rent per sharing spot üí∞üíµ *INCLUDING HEAT AND HOT WATER* is: *$625 per month*

*PROS*:

*1) 10 minutes walking distance from Northeastern University, as close to the campus as one can be, so commuting to and from the university will not be an issue.*

*2) It's in Fenway, one of the best neighborhoods around the university, so safe surroundings are guaranteed!*

*I've talked to the broker and the spots need to be finalized and the applications for them submitted WITHIN A DAY*.

*I would prioritise people who have already finalized NEU, have at least secured a visa interview slot, and are willing to pay a minimal application fee and the first month's rent amount right away to reserve the apartment at once without any further delay.*

P.S - I'm non-vegetarian.

Considering you have a layover(waiting) time of 2 hours between New York and Boston flight ? Are 2 hours enough ??
24/06/22, 02:21 - +91 81053 79956: JFK is pretty quick, you‚Äôve these kiosks where you need to enter some stuff and then there are like multiple sections based on the type of visa you hold and you go there to the immigration officers
24/06/22, 02:21 - +91 95422 19089: 2 hours won‚Äôt be enough for sure‚Ä¶coz you need to pick up the luggage and immigration might take min 1 hour to max 3 hours ( if the line is big) and you need to check in the baggage to Boston flight 1:30 to 2 hours before the flight time!
24/06/22, 02:22 - +91 81053 79956: This is pre covid. So maybe you‚Äôll have to check
24/06/22, 02:22 - +91 81053 79956: Doesn‚Äôt the carrier directly move the baggage to the next connecting flight?
24/06/22, 02:22 - +91 81053 79956: Like how it‚Äôs done In Dubai, say for a Qatar ?
24/06/22, 02:23 - +91 95422 19089: This is connecting flight ‚Ä¶here it will happen
24/06/22, 02:23 - +91 95422 19089: But from New York to Boston it will definetly not be a connection one‚Ä¶
24/06/22, 02:24 - +91 95422 19089: You‚Äôre 1st flight will end at new York and you need to pick the baggage there
24/06/22, 02:24 - +91 81053 79956: Haan it‚Äôll be a diff carrier. But I think it‚Äôs very carrier specific
24/06/22, 02:26 - +91 95013 69226: So 2 hours won‚Äôt be enough ?
24/06/22, 02:27 - +91 97500 00540: Is your arrival and departure flight in the same terminal?
24/06/22, 02:29 - +91 95421 59560: Is uhcr report important to submit

24/06/22, 02:55 - +91 90733 31977: ### *PRIVATE ROOM FINDERS REJOICEE!* ###

Hey guys,

I'm really thrilled to let you know that I've found a really, really spacious *5 bedroom, 1 bathroom apartment* in the *Mission Hill* area and I'm looking to share the apartment with *4 other people each taking a private room* as a permanent accomodation from *1st September 2022* onwards. 

*3 out of the 4 bedrooms are really big and spacious and there's one bedroom which is smaller in size but equally cozy and comfortable!*

The rent for each of the 3 bigger private bedrooms üíµüí∞ *INCLUDING HEAT AND HOT WATER* is: *$850 per month*
The rent for the smaller private bedroomüíµüí∞ *INCLUDING HEAT AND HOT WATER* is: *$600 per month*

*PROS*:

*1) Just 1.2 miles from Northeastern University üéì; that's only a 20-25 minute walk.*
*2) It's in Mission Hill, one of the most student friendly and best neighborhoods around the university, so safe surroundings are guaranteed.*
*3) The unit is RIGHT on üìç Huntington Avenue, so connectivity to the university is ample and really convenient through modes of public transport.* üöâüöç
*4) Each private bedroom can easily fit beds üõå, chairsüí∫, study tables and still have space remaining, so you get your money's worth!*
*5) Each bedroom has it's own built-in closet, so storage won't be an issue for any of the tenants.*
*6) All of the tenants, including myself, will have their names on the lease and that is a guarantee!* üìú
*7) Utilities that are included in your rent are heating and hot water.*
*8) The apartment is really big and spacious, so you'll definitely feel at home.*

*I've talked to the broker about the entire process of application, so I'd like to provide a bit more information than usual here. There are three other interested groups in Boston who have scheduled in-person viewing of the same apartment on Friday 9 AM EST onwards, which will be today Friday 6:30 ‚è≤Ô∏è PM evening IST for us here in India. That's why I would REALLY, REALLY like to find 4 seriously interested people who would definitely confirm their presence by 6:30 PM‚è≥ today, or else we risk losing the apartment to other potential groups already there in Boston.* 

*All you need to do by 6:30 PM today is confirm your presence to me, send me your I-20 and passport and let me know of your full names and email addresses, so that an application form can be sent to you to fill up and submit. üìãWe need to have all 4 roommates, 5 including myself ready by 6:30 PM today, so that as soon as the broker sends the applications to us at 9 AM their time, we can fill them up and submit them. Needless to mention, you may have to stay up a bit late tonight and be alert for the broker's mail, and judging by how responsive he's been throughout the process, I'd definitely not expect any delay.*

*I would prioritise people who have already finalized NEU and have at least secured a visa interview slot, and would be willing to pay a minimal application fee and the first month's rent amount right away, so that we can go ahead and submit our applications for their consideration without any further delay. ‚è≤Ô∏è‚è≤Ô∏è*

*If your requirements match with the above, you're also looking for nice, private bedrooms and you're even a little interested, then kindly DM me. I'll be more than happy to connect and talk about preferences and other queries!*

26/06/22, 15:50 - +91 81053 79956: They don‚Äôt ask for Vaxx certificates and health reports at Immigration. It‚Äôs just your Visa+Passport, I20 I think. But def not medical reports.
26/06/22, 15:55 - +91 90089 44967: I read somewhere that we might be denied entry if we dont have the vaccine certificates!
26/06/22, 15:58 - +1 (617) 646-9996: That is correct!
26/06/22, 15:59 - +91 97241 86425: I think uni is asking
26/06/22, 15:59 - +91 81053 79956: There‚Äôs no federal law around this; nothing standard for the whole of US of A. More so, look up health reports of diff states, they‚Äôre all different. Immigration is not state specific, it‚Äôs federal. More so, it was nowhere mentioned in the whole Visa process about any of these vaccinations. They didn‚Äôt ask for any health reports for tourists, when some of us went there.

Having said that, it‚Äôs best you get it done here because as per the requirement the relevant governing body‚Äôs issued, we need to submit the report a month before we start grad school. It‚Äôs mentioned on the report - Page 1, top right corner
26/06/22, 16:00 - +91 81053 79956: Haha no shit. Yeah that was the premise set here üòÖ
26/06/22, 16:00 - +91 90089 44967: Thanks for this! Ill check
26/06/22, 16:00 - +91 81053 79956: It has nothing to do with the United States denying your entry. You won‚Äôt be allowed to sit for classes.
26/06/22, 16:01 - +91 97241 86425: True
26/06/22, 16:03 - +91 90089 44967: Online classes then xD
26/06/22, 16:03 - +91 80742 43077: That too I think it‚Äôs from the second semester, you won‚Äôt be allowed to register
26/06/22, 16:03 - +91 81053 79956: Dude no, it‚Äôs from term 1 only. It‚Äôs a standard protocol across most schools
26/06/22, 16:03 - +91 81053 79956: Check once
26/06/22, 16:03 - +91 80742 43077: I‚Äôll check
26/06/22, 16:04 - +91 81053 79956: It says both registering and attending

26/06/22, 16:05 - +91 97241 86425: Yup
26/06/22, 16:05 - +91 80742 43077: When
26/06/22, 16:05 - +91 81053 79956: Says tentatively 1 month. It‚Äôs best you initiate a process, since some vaxx require 2 doses, between a specific time range
26/06/22, 16:06 - +91 80742 43077: 1 month before going? Or after
26/06/22, 16:06 - +91 81053 79956: Sometimes its 30 days, sometimes 45. You really don‚Äôt wanna get vaxx beyond like 15 august, just to be on the safer side
26/06/22, 16:06 - +91 81053 79956: Before man!
26/06/22, 16:06 - +91 81053 79956: It says BEFORE entering the university

05/07/22, 13:47 - +91 81053 79956: Hi guys, can someone help me out with the course code for Co-op?
05/07/22, 13:58 - +91 90733 31977: Hey, it's ENCP 6100.
05/07/22, 13:58 - +91 90733 31977: Introduction to Cooperative Education.
05/07/22, 13:59 - +91 81053 79956: All classes are full :/ there are two of them, but unfortunately I‚Äôm not able to register because of some error
05/07/22, 14:03 - +91 97694 08780: Those are reserved is what I was told and hence the error
05/07/22, 14:03 - +91 97694 08780: I think they‚Äôll add more classes so you should ideally be able to register for them
05/07/22, 14:03 - +91 90733 31977: Yeah, apparently a lot of students are facing the same issue. I'd imagine more classes will be added in the near future.
05/07/22, 14:04 - +91 80560 46315: As of now, when I had mailed the college, they told all the slots are full but they hadn‚Äôt mentioned anything regarding new slots opening to me :(
05/07/22, 14:14 - +91 95421 59560: They will give extra slots don‚Äôt worry!!
05/07/22, 14:15 - +91 81053 79956: Damn I really hope they open up more slots. Else it‚Äôll just be in spring!
05/07/22, 14:16 - +91 95421 59560: What if they mail few students that they will defer some students to next semester!!
05/07/22, 14:16 - Ajay Northeastern: üôÑ
05/07/22, 14:17 - +91 81053 79956: Huh what?

05/07/22, 14:17 - +91 99204 99802: As a new Fall 2022 student ENCP is not a required course in the first semester and it is actually preferable that new students take it in their Spring semester. It is up to you if you would like to register you can keep at looking at the sections available as the department is continuing to make changes to the Fall 2022 schedule, but please consider that it is only your first semester.
05/07/22, 14:17 - +91 99204 99802: I received this mail
05/07/22, 14:18 - +91 81053 79956: Makes sense.
05/07/22, 14:18 - +91 95421 59560: Did anyone ask seniors about course registration filling up this fast ??
05/07/22, 14:18 - Ajay Northeastern: I agree!
05/07/22, 14:21 - +91 94817 32692: you can take up project management and a elective of your choice this semester is what one senior adviced me
05/07/22, 14:21 - +91 94817 32692: if it gets full
05/07/22, 14:22 - +91 94817 32692: although most electives require OR and prob stats as pre requisite
05/07/22, 14:22 - +91 99676 78746: I‚Äôd mailed the advisor that I wasn‚Äôt able to register for classes when the course registration mail first came out and received a reply that new registrations would be opening soon. Last week I got to register for Operations Research but haven‚Äôt been able to register for probability and statistics yet.
05/07/22, 14:22 - +91 94817 32692: and I had read also in a circular that students of MEM are adviced to take OR and prob stats in first sem
05/07/22, 14:22 - +91 90089 44967: <Media omitted>
05/07/22, 14:52 - +91 90733 31977: I've heard that EPS and OR are recommended, however, I'm not sure about ENCP 6100. Some say that it's better to take it up in the first semester itself, and some advise against it, like the website itself.
05/07/22, 14:55 - +91 90733 31977: If they don't up any more slots for ENCP 6100, then I'd imagine they'd expect students to take it up in a subsequent semester and that'll be it.
05/07/22, 14:55 - +1 (617) 646-9996: Take it in first semester. You will be prepared early for co op
05/07/22, 15:00 - +91 90733 31977: Okay, noted!
05/07/22, 15:31 - +91 97241 86425: Most seniors told me
05/07/22, 15:31 - +91 97241 86425: That it is better to take co op
05/07/22, 15:32 - +91 97241 86425: As it will give you more time to build resume for co op and also helps in profile improvements

13/07/22, 04:07 - +91 77980 33674: Has anybody started the health insurance process?
13/07/22, 04:08 - +91 98496 14763: You have to pay the health insurance as well as the semester all at once
13/07/22, 04:08 - +91 95421 59560: This message was deleted
13/07/22, 04:09 - +91 98496 14763: The billing will include the semester fee, health insurance and some other miscellaneous fee
13/07/22, 04:15 - +91 97241 86425: how much we will be paying for first sem
13/07/22, 04:15 - +91 89518 17509: When do we need to pay that
13/07/22, 04:15 - +91 89518 17509: ?
13/07/22, 04:15 - +91 98496 14763: For spring i was asked to pay 15.5k
13/07/22, 04:15 - +91 77980 33674: Okayy
13/07/22, 04:16 - +91 98496 14763: You'll get a mail to pay in the month of August
13/07/22, 04:16 - +91 72089 19162: +1
13/07/22, 04:16 - +91 98208 72185: Any alternative options for health insurance.

Or is it compulsory to get it from the university?
13/07/22, 04:19 - +91 98496 14763: We have to choose the university one
13/07/22, 04:19 - +91 97241 86425: can you share the fees breakdown
13/07/22, 04:19 - +91 97241 86425: please
13/07/22, 04:19 - +91 98208 72185: So its compulsory?
13/07/22, 04:20 - +91 98208 72185: Some differences are there . One is from Massachusetts health that is free , tufts medical insurance is around 450 plus and neu one is 2400
13/07/22, 04:20 - +91 98208 72185: It  is like difficult to suggest from other side
13/07/22, 04:20 - +91 98208 72185: Like you can take tufts one
13/07/22, 04:20 - +91 98208 72185: That is 400
13/07/22, 04:21 - +91 98208 72185: I got this info from one senior thats why i was asking.

But he didnt know the process of opting for alternative health insurance
13/07/22, 04:22 - +91 98496 14763: But as the billing itself includes the health insurance so i guess it's compulsory
13/07/22, 04:23 - +91 98496 14763: I didn't take a screenshot at that time  I'll check if it have it or not
13/07/22, 04:23 - +91 97241 86425: that would be helpful , thank you.
13/07/22, 04:39 - +91 85531 32533: You have to fill a form and university will evaluate. You have meet some criteria they have set.

21/07/22, 12:40 - +91 82202 61458: Guys, i have travel idea plan let me know your suggestion. So cost to boston on average all flights cost approx. 1.4 or 1.5. So instead, i am planning go to Dubai on 30th August by obtaining a free 48 hours transit visa, check in nearby hotel for 1 nighr and catch the Emirates on the next day on 31st. The overall including hotel it would cost 1.05 to 1.1L. Is it a safe and viable option?
21/07/22, 12:41 - +91 97500 00540: That's a great idea
Why not make full use of the transit visa, look around Dubai and then catch the flight to Boston?

21/07/22, 12:44 - +91 97500 00540: Hotels usually allow you to keep the luggage with them at the front desk for a while, so contact your hotel and ask if it's possible 
So then you can leave your luggage even after check out, explore the city, come pick it up again and then go to the airport
21/07/22, 12:45 - +91 97500 00540: Shouldn't be an issue but contact Emirates anyway and ask

27/07/22, 01:20 - +91 79012 64113: He made it very clear in the beginning itself that Roombae (the agency they run) doesn‚Äôt charge or insist on charging any amount. 

They only get you a direct contact with the broker. That‚Äôs their job. Help you with finding apartments. 

This is exactly what he did to us as well. And we‚Äôve been with him Since MARCH.
27/07/22, 01:21 - +91 99628 99042: Technically, he needs to book it asap right. Maybe another party is interested as well considering the rental market
27/07/22, 01:21 - +91 95421 59560: We already signed the lease actually and sent 1100$ for verification also
27/07/22, 01:22 - +91 79012 64113: Oh. I don‚Äôt think you should be worried about being associated with them
27/07/22, 01:23 - +91 95421 59560: Yeah, he is fine . I am not saying he is not legit and all, but how he irritates for money as if we are robbers and trying to escape , it‚Äôs not good right? After already sending 1100$
27/07/22, 01:24 - +91 79012 64113: True that. Maybe it‚Äôs only coz the rental market is at its peaks now. Since it‚Äôs only a month left for fall
27/07/22, 01:25 - +91 95421 59560: This wise also irritates for verification and all
27/07/22, 01:25 - +91 95421 59560: Very slow process
27/07/22, 01:29 - +91 99628 99042: Literally everything dude. Jvue doesn't even respond
27/07/22, 02:49 - Jay Oza NEU: Is anyone able to do complete the payment plan offer?

27/07/22, 07:04 - kashiraman1999: Should we submit the vaccination form by August one or 7th?

Here you go - *Where do I Clothes without drilling a hole in my pocket * ü•ºüëöüëïüëñüë†üë¢üëûüëúüëõ

*WINTER CLOTHING Especially*

*Primark* - The best store to get your stuff at a low price. - Downtown Crossing
*BCF* - *Burlington coat factory* - You get branded stuff on clearance. I'd suggest you buy your winter wear from this store. There is one in *Quincy* and one in *Assemblyrow*. - You can also get cutlery and home goods as well
*OldNavy* - Store that has offers/sale going on all the time. - Downtown crossing
*Marshalls* / *TJMAX* - Good stuff - Fenway/Hynes convention centre/Newbury
*Christmas Tree Shops* - Blankets and Throws! 
*Macy's* - You get a lot of stuff here
*Amazon Prime* - If you want to try online shopping!

Even some stores on Newbury has good brands too - You have clearance/good stuff for reasonable prices at times

*Also, if you are buying in bulk, head to New Hampshire, it‚Äôs tax free!*
